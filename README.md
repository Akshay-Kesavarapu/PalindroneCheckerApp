Key Concepts used in UC2:
1.Class – In Java, even the simplest program must be written inside a class, as a class acts as a container to hold program logic.
2.Main Method – Entry point of the Java application with the signature public static void main(String[] args).
3.Static Keyword – Allows the JVM to invoke the main() method without creating an object of the class.
4.String – A built-in Java class used to store and manipulate textual data. Here, it stores the word to be checked for a palindrome.
5.String Literal – Text enclosed within double quotes ("madam"), stored in the String constant pool.
6.Conditional Statement (if-else) – Used to evaluate whether the given string satisfies the palindrome condition.
