# PalindroneCheckerApp
Procedure:
1.Takes a string as input.
2.Checks if the string is palindrome using for loop and reversing the string.
3.Prints out the result.
Flow:
1.Reverse string using loop
2.Compare original and reversed
3.Display result

Display whether the given string is a palindrome by reversing and comparing.

Key Concepts used in UC2:
1.Loop (for loop) – Used to iterate through the characters of the string in reverse order.
2.String Immutability – In Java, String objects are immutable; every modification creates a new String object.
3.String Concatenation (+) – Used to build the reversed string character by character (introduced here to later discuss drawbacks).
4.equals() Method – Used to compare the actual content of two String objects instead of memory references.
